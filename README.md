# TTPD Log In
This was a part of a homework(but not really) for school, tho the assignement was more focused on training on this being a mobile-first website and to then scale it up so its responsive.
But i didn't want to just make a simple site and be done with it. No, I wanted to play around with it and see if i could push myself to try to make something interesting and unique.

So in Figma i started to just try some diffrent ideas, when suddenly i got the songs from Taylor Swift's "The Tortured Poets Department" album in my head and 
I got exited to want to try and replicate the mood and feel of it into a log in site. 

This was my mockup:
